        <div class="ideatext">
            <h5>as we tend to change and grow our dreams mean more now then they did before. for some people atleast. dreams empower teh ideas we have daily and it turns them into a immersive world that is unbound by natural laws and rules in the real world. sometimes giving us hope, happines, wonder, ambition, or even sadness, worry, terror. The idea is that we take these manifestations and use them. to inspire the same wonder when your awake. the dream doesnt have to be a sleeping one, it can be anything you desire so much but is out of grasp, or ideas you cant seem to fully understand, or an idea your pationate about and this idea or thought makes you feel a certain way. it makes you appreciate everything worlds more for a breif moment as you solve your own pondering. thats the idea. </h5>
