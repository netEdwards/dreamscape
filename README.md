# dreamscape

This is a WIP, I work full time techinically so I am not able to have full development on it right now-
For now I am just trying to a page to layout the Back-End on. 
I will be using a website I came up with while in school called Dreamscape.

I have always wanted a digital dream jounral (not r/dreams) that will be visible to everyone.

So I plan to develop a journal like forum that will be open source, not my exact website I will pulilsh but this is the Front-End so far :)

-However once I do get time it will be an awesome dream forum I hope!
